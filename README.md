Welcome to the documentation for [Echo](https://github.com/digantamisra98/Echo).

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="About" %}
Echo is a python package containing novel, validated methods and layers employed in deep neural networks which are not natively available in popular libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow.

> Let your neural network Echo!
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Objectives" %}
Our goal with Echo is to provide a single, easy to use, well documented package which contains all the novel methods proposed in deep learning without the hassle of you to write it's code. With our support of PyTorch and TensorFlow, we want to ensure you spend more time experimenting new modules rather than coding them from scratch. 
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Creators" %}
Echo started as a passionate idea by two individuals:

* Diganta Misra
