Welcome to the documentation for [Echo](https://github.com/digantamisra98/Echo). \(_**Under Construction**_\)

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="About" %}
Echo is a python package containing novel, validated methods and layers employed in deep neural networks which are not natively available in popular libraries like [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [MegEngine ](https://megengine.org.cn/)and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

> Let your neural network Echo!
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Objectives" %}
Our goal with Echo is to provide a single, easy to use, well documented package which contains all the novel methods proposed in deep learning without the hassle of you to write it's code. With our support of PyTorch, MegEngine and TensorFlow, we want to ensure that you spend more time experimenting new modules rather than coding them from scratch. 
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Creators" %}
Echo started as a passionate idea by two individuals:

* [Diganta Misra](https://digantamisra98.github.io/)
* [Alexandra Deis](https://lexie88rus.github.io/)

It was further enhanced and supported by:

* [Sasikanth Kotti](https://github.com/ksasi)
* [Soumik Rakshit](https://soumik12345.github.io/)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Community" %}
Echo is a community driven and supported project. We highly encourage researchers, practitioners and OSS enthusiasts to contribute to Echo. 

Please check out our [contributing guidelines](https://xa9ax.gitbook.io/echo/contributing-guidelines) before submitting a pull request or raising an issue.



Thanks!
